# GetGPSFromDroidScript
Program is designed to take a video it recorded from using another application on my phone (since the phone app, w/o paying a monthly subscription - fuck you, im smarter than that) to make video -> frame images -> crop -> Image to  text , inorder for me to track my location more accurately myself in PokemonGo (use the application for GPS as an overlay)

(theroredically, I could strap othert sensors onto this as well later on :) )
